# H1-B Visa: Exploration of public Enigma H1-B Visa

In this exploration, I investigate the H1-B visa dataset made publically available by Enigma.

First, I determine which companies in NYC applied for the largest number of H1-B visas.
Then, I computed the mean and standard deviation of wages in NYC and Mountain View to determine if the values are statistically different.

I brainstorm a list of various interesting questions that could be addressed with this dataset. After scoping out these questions, I chose to tackle one of the most interesting questions.

I built a logistic regression model to determine if an application will be accepted or rejected.
